# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in psychology.
- I am taking STATS 220 because I'd like to learn how to take advantage of technology to process and communicate statistical knowledge.
- I am interested in learning about web scraping and the programming language R.

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is this ![locked in cat](https://c.tenor.com/wyrw1dq9J6MAAAAd/tenor.gif)
